		<p>
		My name is Alissa Kennedy, and I'm passionate about creating beautiful, captivating graphics and user-friendly websites that weave ideas into compelling visuals. I became passionate about web design as a way to tell effective brand stories and elicit meaningful web-based interactions.</p>

		<p>
		Outside work, I enjoy film photography, fine art and studying color psychology. I recently found an interest in reading philosophy. I also like coffee.</p>
		
		<p>This is just a practice webpage that I use to practice GitHub. If you would like to see my work visit my portfolio at <a href="http://www.alissakennedy.com">www.alissakennedy.com</a></p>
