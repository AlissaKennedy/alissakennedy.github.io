		<p>
		My name is Alissa Kennedy, and I'm passionate about creating beautiful, captivating graphics and user-friendly websites that weave ideas into compelling visuals.</p>

		<p>
		I started coding when I was about 10 years old. I would play with code generators to deck out my Neopets pages. My favorite thing to to was to change the scroll bar color. Does anyone else remember when we could still do that? Later on I would make snazzy MySpace designs for my friends. R.I.P. MySpace.</p>

		<p>
		Outside work, I enjoy film photography, fine art and studying color psychology. I recently found an interest in reading philosophy. I also like coffee and coloring books.</p>

		<p>This is just a practice webpage that I use to practice GitHub. If you would like to see my work visit my portfolio at <a href="http://www.alissakennedy.com">www.alissakennedy.com</a></p>
